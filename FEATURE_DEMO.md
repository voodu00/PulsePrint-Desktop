# Card View and Table View Toggle Feature

## Overview

This feature adds the ability to switch between a card-based view (current default) and a table-based view for displaying printers on the dashboard. **Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND COMPLETE**

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. View Toggle Component (`ViewToggle.tsx`) ✅

- **Location**: `frontend-react/src/components/ViewToggle.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Provides a toggle button to switch between card and table views
- **Design**: Uses shadcn/ui Button components with Grid3X3 and List icons
- **Responsive**: Shows text labels on larger screens, icons only on mobile
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions with hover effects and visual feedback

### 2. Table View Component (`PrinterTable.tsx`) ✅

- **Location**: `frontend-react/src/components/PrinterTable.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays printers in a tabular format with columns for:
  - Printer (name, model, IP)
  - Status (with colored badges and error messages)
  - Progress (with progress bar, filename, layer info, time remaining)
  - Filament (type, color indicator, remaining percentage)
  - Temperatures (nozzle, bed, chamber - when enabled in settings)
  - Actions (pause, resume, stop buttons)
- **Features**:
  - Responsive design with horizontal scrolling on mobile
  - Flash animations for idle/error states (matching card view)
  - Real-time updates via MQTT

### 3. Settings Integration ✅

- **Location**: `frontend-react/src/types/settings.ts`
- **New Setting**: `viewMode: 'card' | 'table'`
- **Default**: Card view (maintains existing behavior)
- **Persistence**: **Stored in SQLite database** via tauri-plugin-sql
- **Architecture**: Professional desktop app storage approach

### 4. Dashboard Integration ✅

- **Location**: `frontend-react/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added ViewToggle component in the header area
  - Conditional rendering based on `settings.viewMode`
  - Maintains all existing functionality (real-time updates, printer actions)
  - Smooth view transitions with fade-in animations

### 5. Animation Enhancements ✅

- **View Transitions**: Fade-in animations (0.4s) with upward slide for both views
- **Staggered Animations**: Cards animate in sequentially with 0.05s delays
- **Button Interactions**: Hover effects and active states for toggle buttons
- **Flash Notifications**: Both views support idle/error flashing based on settings

## User Experience

### Card View (Default) ✅

- Existing grid layout with printer cards
- Shows detailed information in a visually appealing card format
- Responsive grid that adapts to screen size
- Smooth animations for individual cards
- Flash animations for idle/error states when enabled

### Table View (New) ✅

- Compact tabular layout showing more printers at once
- Sortable columns with all essential information
- Better for users with many printers (5-10+ printers)
- Responsive table with horizontal scrolling on mobile
- Flash animations for table rows in idle/error states
- Consistent action buttons and real-time updates

### View Toggle ✅

- Located in the top-right area of the dashboard
- Only appears when printers are present
- Immediate switching with smooth animations
- Preference is saved in SQLite database and persists across sessions
- Professional desktop app behavior

## Technical Implementation

### Database Storage ✅

```sql
-- User preferences stored in SQLite
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Settings stored as JSON in 'app_settings' key
{
    "viewMode": "card",
    "showTemperatures": true,
    "idleNotifications": false,
    "errorNotifications": true,
    // ... other settings
}
```

### Frontend Components ✅

```typescript
// ViewToggle component
interface ViewToggleProps {
	viewMode: 'card' | 'table'
	onViewModeChange: (mode: 'card' | 'table') => void
}

// PrinterTable component
interface PrinterTableProps {
	printers: Printer[]
	onPause: (printerId: string) => void
	onResume: (printerId: string) => void
	onStop: (printerId: string) => void
}
```

### Settings Integration ✅

```typescript
// Updated SettingsState
export interface SettingsState {
	// ... existing settings
	viewMode: 'card' | 'table'
}

// Database-backed settings service
class TauriMqttService {
	async getSettings(): Promise<SettingsState>
	async saveSettings(settings: SettingsState): Promise<void>
}
```

### Real-time Updates ✅

- Both views receive the same real-time MQTT updates
- All existing printer actions (pause, resume, stop) work in both views
- Statistics and status updates are synchronized
- Flash animations work in both views based on settings

## Testing ✅

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for both new components (98 tests passing)
- **Integration**: Tested with database-backed settings context
- **Responsive**: Verified on different screen sizes
- **Functionality**: All printer actions work in both views
- **Animations**: Flash effects and transitions tested
- **Database**: Settings persistence verified with SQLite storage

## Database Architecture ✅

### Current Implementation

- **Storage**: SQLite database via tauri-plugin-sql
- **Location**: Platform-specific app data directory
- **Schema**: `user_preferences` table with key-value storage
- **Migrations**: Automatic schema updates
- **Type Safety**: Rust backend with proper error handling

### Benefits Achieved

- **Professional Desktop App**: No browser storage dependencies
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent storage across Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new settings and preferences
- **Reliable**: Database transactions ensure data integrity
- **Performance**: Fast local database operations

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files ✅
